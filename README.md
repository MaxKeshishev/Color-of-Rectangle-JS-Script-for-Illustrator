# Color-of-Rectangle-JS-Script-for-Illustrator

Task:
The Illustrator file contains rectangles, each of them needs to have color information in RGB, CMYK, and HEX formats

How to work with the script:
1) Place the script file in Adobe\Adobe Illustrator 2023\Presets\en_GB\Scripts
2) Select the rectangles in the Illustrator file
3) Click File -> Scripts -> Color of Rectangle

You can improve:
1) Now the script technically works for any shapes, but it only looks good on rectangles. So you can rework the algorithm for placing text and calculating its size
2) Now it is impossible to cancel the script action in one Ctrl+Z, you have to press it several times
3) Now the script spends about one second to place the text for each shape, because you need to create a new style each time. If you know how to speed it up, please tell me
